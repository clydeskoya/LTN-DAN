# Midnight Drive

## Concept
A moody synthwave track that captures the feeling of driving through a city at 2 AM. Heavy emphasis on atmospheric pads and pulsing bass, with occasional lead synth melodies that evoke street lights passing by.

## Structure
1. Intro (16 bars)
   - Atmospheric pad fading in
   - Gradual introduction of pulsing bass
   - Light arpeggios in background
2. Verse (32 bars)
   - Main synth melody enters
   - Driving rhythm with 16th note bass
3. Chorus (16 bars)
   - Wide, expansive pad chords
   - Strong lead synth melody
   - Heavy sidechaining on bass
4. Bridge (16 bars)
   - Strip back to minimal elements
   - Build tension with rising arpeggios
5. Outro (24 bars)
   - Gradual fade out of elements
   - Return to atmospheric pad

## Melody Ideas
```
Main Theme:
Cm - G - | Ab - Bb - |
Lead pattern: C - Eb - G - Bb - G - Eb
```

## Harmony
- Verse: Cm - G - Ab - Bb
- Chorus: Ab - Bb - Gm - Cm
- Bridge: Sustained Cm with chromatic walkups

## Sound Design
1. Lead:
   - Jupiter-8 style lead with moderate resonance
   - Light chorus effect
   - Delay time: 1/8 dotted
2. Bass:
   - Moog-style bass with slight overdrive
   - Heavy sidechaining to kick
   - Low pass filter movement
3. Pads:
   - Juno-106 style pad with chorus
   - Long attack and release
   - Subtle filter movement
4. Effects:
   - Tape saturation on master
   - Light vinyl crackle in background
   - Reverb sends for atmosphere

## Production Notes
- Processing:
  - Sidechain compression on bass and pads
  - Tape saturation on master bus
  - Parallel compression on drums
- Mixing ideas:
  - Keep bass mono below 100Hz
  - Wide stereo field for pads
  - Drums punchy but not dominant
- Special effects:
  - Automated filter sweeps during transitions
  - Tape stop effect before bridge
